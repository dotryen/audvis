# Bake Drivers

Finds all the drivers using audvis() expressions everywhere and bakes them into classical animation data, so you can
render your animation on a render farm or on a PC without AudVis installed.

## Settings

- **Bake Drivers** - start baking all the drivers. You can stop it by pressing Esc
- **Nonstop Baking Collection** - if a collection is selected, baking will be performed on the go, as YOU move along the
  frames. If you jump to frame 143, data will be baked to the frame 143. This can be changed in the future.
- **Edit Driver Expressions Here** only if **Nonstop Baking Collection** is selected. If enabled, you will see a list of all driver expressions in the selected collection
